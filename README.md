Paste-Into-P4Merge
====================

Mac Shortcut to allow pasting into P4Merge.

P4Merge (https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core-apps/merge-diff-tool-p4merge) is a powerful diff/merge tool that shows intra-line changes.  However, it requires text to be in existing files before they can be opened.

PasteDiff is a Mac Shortcut which takes in two text inputs, creates appropriate temporary files, and passes them into P4Merge.
PasteUnidiff is another Mac Shortcut which takes in a text input (a unified diff), creates appropriate temporary files, and passes them into P4Merge so you can see the intra-line changes.  (This is very rough right now)

You can open the .shortcut files in Shortcuts to edit the workflow.
